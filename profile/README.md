### Naming Conventions
All repositories and branches must follow **kebab-case**.

- **Repositories**: all lowercase, hyphen-separated.  
  Example: `aiirlab-paper-bias-detection`
- **Branches**: use a clear prefix.  
  Example: `feature/query-suggestion`, `fix/search-timeout`

### Where to Place Work
- **Research papers** → create a new repository.  
- **MathMex features** → create a branch in the `mathmex` repo.

If you're unsure of where exactly you should place your work, talk with the Lab's Assistant Director for help.

### Getting Started
1. Fork or clone the right repo.  
2. Create a branch using the correct prefix.  
3. Push your work and open a pull request.
